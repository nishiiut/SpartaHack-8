Inspiration  
Our team members consist of international student! Since English is the second language for all of us, we had shared our experiences how we first learned English when we were young. We also wanted to help international children's parent who can't help study their child for kindergarten. Starting from a simple idea how to learn English, we came up with creating an open educational application for children not only learn English but also prepare them to attend Kindergarten.  
  
What it does  
Our application 'Prepare fore Kindergarten' has two functions. 1. Matching words Matching words has four categories (number, food, animal, and shape) that enable children to pick a right word matching with a picture. 2. Writing a name Children can practice writing their name on a canvas with mouse so that they write their name before attend the kindergarten.  
  
How we built it  
We mainly used the library called Tkinter to build our application.  
  
Challenges we ran into  
We recognize that there are many applications for children education. To differentiate our application from the existed ones, we focused on the specific target, children 5 years and below, who will be attend kindergarten soon. As a result, we could come up with the specific functions which are helpful to our target audience.  
  
Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We understood the needs for our audience needs, and their needs can be met through the app.
